\description{
This dataset, AIPulmonaryNodules_df, is a data frame containing data from a study on the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) risk stratification tool for assessing Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules (IPNs) in chest CT scans. The dataset includes information on whether cancer was diagnosed and the AI tool's rating of the probability of cancer (from 0 to 100).
