Data taken from the asaur package.

\description{
This dataset, ProstateSurvival_df, is a data frame containing survival times for two competing causes: time from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from prostate cancer, and time from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from other causes. The data set also contains information on several risk factors. The data in this data set are simulated from detailed competing risk survival curves and counts of numbers of patients per group presented in Lu-Yao et al. (2009).
