\description{
This dataset, BloodStorageProstate_df, is a data frame containing data on 316 men who underwent radical prostatectomy and received a transfusion during or within 30 days of the surgery. The dataset includes demographic, baseline, and prognostic factors, as well as data on the time to biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, as indicated by prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels.
The main exposure of interest was the red blood cell (RBC) storage duration group, and the outcome of interest was time to PSA cancer recurrence.

\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'BloodStorageProstate_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem.
This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the OncoDataSets package and assists users in identifying
its specific characteristics. The suffix '_df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame. The original content has not been modified in any way.
