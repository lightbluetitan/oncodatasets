\description{
This dataset, MiceDeathRadiation_df, is a data frame containing data on deaths of RFM male mice exposed to 300 rads of x-radiation at 5â€“6 weeks of age. The dataset records the causes of death, which include thymic lymphoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, and other causes. Additionally, it distinguishes between mice kept in a conventional environment and those in a germ-free environment.
